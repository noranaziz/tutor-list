# Phase 1: Planning and Setup

## Define Requirements:
**Key features:**
- Student management: add, edit, and delete student profiles; view student progress and history.
- Schedule management: view and manage sessions in a calendar or list format.
- Attendance Tracking: mark attendance for each session and track overall attendance rates.
- Billing Management: track payments due, generate invoices, and notify tutors of overdue payments.
- Dashboard: display an overview of upcoming sessions, pending payments, and key metrics.

## Select Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React + tailwind css for UI.
- **Backend**: Flask for REST API.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (look into Supabase for hosting).
- **Hosting**: use docker for containerization. will figure out the rest later!

## Set Up the Project:
- Initialize a GitHub repository.
- Set up project structure for frontend and backend.
- Configure Docker for containerized development.

# Phase 2: Database Design
## Define Entities:
- **Students**: Name, contact info, subjects, attendance records, billing details.
- **Sessions**: Date, time, subject, tutor, student(s), attendance status.
- **Payments**: Student, amount, due date, status.

## Design Schema:
- Create relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-many for students and sessions).
- Use PostgreSQL to create and test schema.

## Seed Data:
- Add sample student, session, and billing data for development and testing.

# Phase 3: Backend Development
## Set Up Flask/Django:
Create endpoints for CRUD operations:
- **Students**: Add, edit, delete, view profiles.
- **Sessions**: Schedule, update, mark attendance.
- **Payments**: Add, track, mark as paid/unpaid.

## Authentication: 
- Add login/logout functionality using JWT or session-based authentication.

## Test API: 
- Use tools like Postman to verify endpoints.

# Phase 4: Frontend Development
## Set Up React:
- Create components for the dashboard, student management, schedule, attendance, and billing.
- Use state management (e.g., Context API or Redux) to manage app data.

## Integrate with Backend:
- Connect React components to backend APIs.
- Handle API responses and errors gracefully.

## Design UI:
- Use a design library like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for a professional look.
- Ensure the app is mobile-responsive.

# Phase 5: Deployment
## Prepare for Deployment:
- Create a production build for React.
- Use Docker to containerize the app.

## Deploy:
- Deploy the backend to Render, Railway, or Heroku.
- Host the frontend on Vercel or Netlify.
- Connect the backend and frontend.

## Test in Production:
- Verify all features work as expected in the live environment.

# Phase 6: Additional Features
## Notifications:
- Add email or SMS reminders for sessions and payments.

## Advanced Billing:
- Allow tutors to generate invoices or track payment history.

## Analytics Dashboard:
- Display stats like total sessions, payments collected, and attendance rates.

# Phase 7: Maintenance
## Bug Fixes:
- Monitor user feedback and fix issues promptly.

## Performance Optimization:
- Optimize database queries and API response times.

## Regular Updates:
- Add features or improve existing ones based on user needs.

# Data Flow Diagram (High-Level)
(replace this with actual diagram)

## Actors:
- **Tutor**: Interacts with the app to manage students, schedules, and billing.
- **App**: Processes tutor actions and communicates with the backend.
- **Backend**: Handles API requests and interacts with the database.
- **Database**: Stores all data for students, sessions, and billing.

## Flow:
1. Tutor requests data or performs an action (e.g., adds a student) via the app.
2. The app sends an API request to the backend.
3. The backend processes the request and queries or updates the database.
4. The database returns the requested data or confirmation of the update.
5. The backend sends a response to the app, which updates the UI for the tutor.
